## ISO27001 Implementation

### Access Control Implementation
```yaml
access_control:
  policies:
    - name: role_based_access
      type: mandatory
      controls:
        - user_registration
        - privilege_management
        - password_management
        - access_review
      review_frequency: quarterly

  authentication:
    primary: 
      method: vault_approle
      rotation: 90d
    secondary:
      method: jwt_token
      expiration: 24h

  authorization:
    model: RBAC
    roles:
      - admin
      - developer
      - operator
      - auditor
```

### Information Security
```yaml
information_security:
  data_classification:
    levels:
      - confidential:
          encryption: required
          access: restricted
          audit: full
      - internal:
          encryption: required
          access: role-based
          audit: selective
      - public:
          encryption: optional
          access: authenticated
          audit: minimal

  cryptography:
    algorithms:
      symmetric: AES-256-GCM
      asymmetric: RSA-4096
    key_management:
      rotation: 90d
      backup: encrypted
      storage: hardware_security_module
```

## GDPR Compliance

### Data Protection Measures
```yaml
data_protection:
  personal_data:
    identification:
      - name
      - email
      - ip_address
    handling:
      encryption: mandatory
      retention: specified
      access_logging: enabled

  processing_records:
    documentation:
      - purpose
      - categories
      - recipients
      - safeguards
    review:
      frequency: quarterly
      approver: dpo
```

### Rights Implementation
```yaml
data_subject_rights:
  supported_rights:
    - right_to_access:
        implementation: api_endpoint
        response_time: 30d
    - right_to_rectification:
        implementation: admin_portal
        verification: required
    - right_to_erasure:
        implementation: automated_workflow
        backup_cleanup: included
```

## Audit Framework

### Audit Trail Configuration
```yaml
audit_logging:
  storage:
    type: encrypted_s3
    retention: 7y
    backup: cross_region

  events:
    authentication:
      - login_attempts
      - password_changes
      - role_changes
    data_access:
      - read_operations
      - write_operations
      - delete_operations
    compliance:
      - policy_changes
      - permission_updates
      - data_exports
```

### Monitoring Setup
```yaml
compliance_monitoring:
  metrics:
    collection:
      interval: 5m
      retention: 365d
    categories:
      - access_control
      - data_protection
      - security_events

  alerts:
    definitions:
      - name: unauthorized_access
        severity: critical
        threshold: immediate
      - name: encryption_failure
        severity: critical
        threshold: immediate
      - name: compliance_violation
        severity: high
        threshold: 5m
```

## Security Controls

### Encryption Standards
```yaml
encryption_framework:
  data_at_rest:
    method: AES-256-GCM
    key_rotation: 90d
    storage: vault_transit

  data_in_transit:
    method: TLS_1.3
    certificate_management: automated
    validation: strict

  key_management:
    storage: hsm
    backup: encrypted
    access: restricted
```

### Access Management
```yaml
access_management:
  authentication:
    primary: vault_approle
    secondary: jwt
    mfa: required

  authorization:
    model: rbac
    roles:
      admin:
        permissions: [create, read, update, delete]
        scope: [all_resources]
      operator:
        permissions: [read, update]
        scope: [assigned_resources]
```

## Compliance Reporting

### Automated Reports
