# ML Engineering Guidelines

## 1. Model Development Workflow

### Initial Setup
- Fix random seeds for reproducibility across all randomization points
- Start with simplest possible model architecture and data pipeline
- Disable all fancy additions (data augmentation etc.) initially
- Initialize model weights and biases appropriately for your task
- Verify loss is at expected value during initialization
- Establish human baseline performance as benchmark

### Validation Pipeline
- Create input-independent baseline (zero input) as sanity check
- Overfit single small batch first to verify architecture
- Verify training loss decreases as model capacity increases
- Visualize predictions on fixed test batch during training
- Monitor prediction dynamics for instability signs
- Validate gradients only affect relevant inputs using backprop

### Model Selection & Training
- Start with proven architectures from literature vs novel designs
- Use Adam optimizer (lr=3e-4) for initial development
- Add complexity (signals, data) one component at a time
- Validate each addition improves performance
- Carefully tune learning rate decay schedules
- Monitor first layer weights and activations for issues

## 2. Data Processing Best Practices 

### Feature Engineering
- Scale features appropriately based on algorithm type:
  - Required: kNN, PCA, gradient descent
  - Optional: Tree models, LDA, Naive Bayes
- Handle missing data and outliers explicitly
- Validate feature distributions and correlations
- Create features incrementally and validate utility

### Data Quality
- Verify data schema and expectations
- Check for data leakage across train/test
- Validate preprocessing steps maintain data integrity  
- Monitor for drift in feature distributions
- Implement data validation tests

## 3. Testing & Validation

### Model Testing
- Unit test model components independently
- Test with fixed random seeds
- Validate loss and metrics on toy datasets
- Test convergence on simplified problems
- Monitor resource usage and performance

### System Testing  
- Test end-to-end pipelines
- Validate data processing steps
- Test model serialization and loading
- Verify prediction serving paths
- Monitor production metrics

## 4. Production Considerations

### Model Serving
- Log predictions and model inputs
- Monitor prediction latency
- Track feature distributions for drift
- Set up metrics dashboards
- Create alerts for issues

### Maintenance
- Retrain models regularly on new data
- Validate performance doesn't degrade
- Monitor system resources
- Update dependencies securely
- Maintain documentation
