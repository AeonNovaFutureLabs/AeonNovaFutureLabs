# 241213_PROC_SOP_INT_v1.0_ANFL

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
This document establishes a unified Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) framework for Aeon Nova Future Labs, consolidating naming conventions, document management, security protocols, and workflow procedures into a single system to ensure consistency, security, and operational efficiency.

---

## 1. Documentation Standards

### 1.1 Unified Naming Convention
```yaml
naming_structure:
  format: "[YYMMDD]_[CATEGORY]_[TYPE]_[AUDIENCE]_[VERSION]_ANFL"
  rules:
    date: "YYMMDD"
    separator: "_"
    case: "UPPERCASE for category and type"
    version: "v[MAJOR].[MINOR]"
    suffix: "ANFL"

  categories:
    ARCH: Architecture components
    PROC: Processes and SOPs
    SEC: Security frameworks
    BUS: Business documentation
    TECH: Technical specifications
    OPS: Operations
    STRAT: Strategic planning
    AUDIT: Audit and compliance
    DOC: Documentation management

  audience:
    INT: Internal teams only
    EXT: External partners
    PUB: Public documentation
    RES: Restricted access

  examples:
    - "241213_PROC_SOP_INT_v1.0_ANFL.md"
    - "241213_SEC_FRAMEWORK_INT_v1.0_ANFL.md"
    - "241213_TECH_NEURAL_INT_v1.0_ANFL.md"
```

### 1.2 Document Structure
All documents must include the following sections:

```yaml
required_sections:
  metadata_header:
    - Document Title
    - Security Level
    - Owner
    - Last Modified Date

  bluf:
    position: "Top"
    purpose: "Clear, actionable summary"

  main_body:
    sections:
      - Overview or Architecture diagrams
      - Implementation details
      - Security and compliance considerations
      - Integration points (if applicable)

  version_history:
    position: "Bottom"
    format: "Table with version, date, and changes"

  next_steps:
    position: "End"
    components:
      - Immediate tasks
      - Future improvements
      - References to doc_plan_status.md for tracking progress
```

---

## 2. Document Management

### 2.1 Creation & Maintenance Workflow
```yaml
document_lifecycle:
  creation:
    - Check doc_plan_status.md to confirm document necessity and status
    - Use templates aligned with naming and structural conventions
    - Include initial BLUF and required sections

  review:
    - Technical Review: Validate code snippets, architecture alignment, and performance implications
    - Security & Compliance Review: Verify ISO27001, GDPR, and quantum security references
    - Documentation Review: Confirm format compliance, cross-references, and completeness

  approval:
    - Technical Lead: Ensures architectural and implementation accuracy
    - Security Team: Validates adherence to security frameworks and compliance
    - Final Sign-Off: Owner updates doc_plan_status.md to "Final" status

  maintenance:
    - Quarterly Reviews: Validate technical accuracy and compliance alignment
    - Bi-Annual Audits: Confirm naming conventions, section completeness, and cross-reference integrity
    - Version Control: Major versions for breaking changes or major updates; minor versions for iterative improvements
```

### 2.2 Integration with doc_plan_status.md
- Always refer to `241213_DOC_PLAN_STATUS_INT_v1.0_ANFL.md` for current document statuses, next review dates, and any known gaps.
- Update doc_plan_status after each significant revision or upon adding new documents.

---

## 3. Quality Control

### 3.1 Automated & Manual Checks
```yaml
validation_process:
  automated:
    - Naming convention checker (file name and headers)
    - Markdown linting & formatting checks
    - Link and cross-reference validation scripts

  manual:
    - Technical correctness review by subject matter experts (SMEs)
    - Security verification by Security Team
    - Content clarity and completeness by Documentation Lead
```

### 3.2 Compliance & Security Validation
- Each document referencing security measures must align with `241213_SEC_FRAMEWORK_INT_vX.X_ANFL` and comply with ISO27001 and GDPR standards.
- Quantum security and blockchain verification details should be correctly referenced and up-to-date.
- Any changes that affect compliance or security posture must trigger a security review before approval.

---

## 4. Security Integration

### 4.1 Access Control & Classification
- Mark each document with appropriate audience and security level (INT, EXT, PUB, or RES).
- Restricted or security-sensitive documents require Vault-based access control and must not be shared externally.

### 4.2 Secure Maintenance
- Changes to compliance-related documents must be logged in an audit trail.
- Security-sensitive details (encryption keys, policies) must reference secret management procedures (see `241213_SEC_OPS_INT_vX.X_ANFL`).

---

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Template Adherence
- Use provided templates, ensuring required sections are present.
- Leverage YAML code blocks and Mermaid diagrams for standardization.
- Reference sample docs (e.g., `241213_TECH_DOCPLAN_INT_v1.0_ANFL` or `241213_START_HERE_v1.0_ANFL.md`) for formatting cues.

### 5.2 Continuous Improvement
- Identify gaps or future improvements in `241213_FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS_v1.0_ANFL.md`.
- Propose enhancements during quarterly reviews.
- Update relevant documents promptly after approving improvements or introducing new technologies (e.g., new PQC algorithms, updated compliance rules).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Distribute this updated SOP framework to all teams.
2. Update `241213_DOC_PLAN_STATUS_INT_v1.0_ANFL.md` to reflect current SOP adoption.

### Future Enhancements
1. Integrate automated doc validation directly into CI/CD pipelines.
2. Expand automated checks for PQC references and compliance verifications.
3. Add a user guide for onboarding documentation processes.
