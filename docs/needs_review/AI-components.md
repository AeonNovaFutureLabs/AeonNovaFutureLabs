# Aeon Nova AI Components

This document provides an overview of the key AI components in the Aeon Nova system.

## 1. Core AI Model

- **Purpose**: Serves as the foundation for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Technology**: Large Language Model (LLM) based on transformer architecture.
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Natural language processing
  - Code understanding and generation
  - Context-aware responses

## 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

- **Purpose**: Enhances AI responses with relevant information from the knowledge base.
- **Components**:
  - Vector Store: For efficient similarity search
  - Document Retriever: Fetches relevant documents
  - Response Generator: Combines retrieved information with AI-generated content

## 3. Federated Learning System

- **Purpose**: Enables distributed model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy.
- **Key Features**:
  - Decentralized training
  - Secure aggregation of model updates
  - Differential privacy mechanisms

## 4. Meta Learning System

- **Purpose**: Allows the AI to adapt quickly to new tasks with minimal training data.
- **Approaches**:
  - Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
  - Prototypical Networks
  - Few-shot learning techniques

## 5. AI Pipeline

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Tokenization
   - Embedding generation

2. **Context Enrichment**:
   - RAG system activation
   - Relevant information retrieval

3. **Model Inference**:
   - Core AI model processing
   - Meta-learning adaptations

4. **Output Generation**:
   - Response formatting
   - Code generation (if applicable)

5. **Continuous Learning**:
   - Federated learning updates
   - Meta-learning task adaptation

## 6. Ethical AI Considerations

- Bias detection and mitigation
- Explainable AI techniques
- Privacy-preserving methods
- Ethical decision-making frameworks

## 7. Performance Metrics

- Response accuracy
- Processing time
- Resource utilization
- Adaptation speed (for meta-learning)
- Privacy preservation (for federated learning)
