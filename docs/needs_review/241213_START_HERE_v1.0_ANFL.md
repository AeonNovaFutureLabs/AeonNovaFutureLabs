# Getting Started with Aeon Nova Framework

## Audience
New team members and external contractors who need a high-level overview.

## What This Framework Does
The Aeon Nova Framework integrates AI models, vector stores, quantum-secure cryptography, and a robust infrastructure for scalable, secure deployments.

## Key Components
1. **Architecture (241213_ARCH_SYSTEM_INT_vX.X_ANFL)**:
   - Multi-region AWS-based infrastructure
   - Secure networking with Route53, VPC, ECS, and more

2. **AI & ML (e.g., 241213_TECH_NEURAL_INT_vX.X_ANFL, 241213_TECH_VECTOR_INT_vX.X_ANFL)**:
   - Neural network training and inference (Transformer-based, quantum-secure)
   - Vector store integration for fast similarity search and retrieval
   - Model registry to manage versions, provenance, and metadata

3. **Security & Compliance (e.g., 241213_SEC_FRAMEWORK_INT_vX.X_ANFL, 241213_SEC_COMPLIANCE_INT_vX.X_ANFL)**:
   - ISO27001 and GDPR compliance frameworks
   - Post-quantum cryptography (lattice-based encryption)
   - Blockchain-based verification for model integrity

4. **Operations & Monitoring (e.g., 241213_OPS_MAINTAIN_INT_vX.X_ANFL, 241213_TECH_MONITOR_INT_vX.X_ANFL)**:
   - CI/CD pipelines and Terraform for automated deployments
   - Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and alerting
   - Routine maintenance, backup procedures, and DR strategies

## Getting Involved
- **First Steps**:
  1. Review the DOCPLAN Status (`/company_docs/doc_plan_status.md`) to understand the document landscape.
  2. Read the Architecture Overview doc (241213_ARCH_SYSTEM_INT_vX.X_ANFL) to grasp the systemâ€™s high-level structure.
  3. Check the Development Standards (241213_DEV_STANDARDS_INT_vX.X_ANFL) to align with coding and testing practices.

- **Suggested Reading Path**:
  - If you're joining the ML team, focus on Neural, Vector, and RAG docs first.
  - If you're on Infra or Ops, read Infrastructure and Operations docs.
  - For Security or Compliance roles, deep dive into the Security and Compliance frameworks and related policies.
