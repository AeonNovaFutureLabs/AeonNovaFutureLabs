# 241116_SEC_INCIDENT_INT_v1.0_ANFL

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
Comprehensive security incident response procedures establishing standardized protocols for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents while maintaining system integrity and data protection. Focuses on immediate response actions, containment strategies, and post-incident analysis.

## 1. Incident Classification

### 1.1 Severity Levels
```yaml
severity_matrix:
  critical:
    characteristics:
      - System-wide compromise
      - Data breach
      - Service unavailability
    response_time: "Immediate (< 15 minutes)"
    escalation: "Executive team"

  high:
    characteristics:
      - Partial system compromise
      - Potential data exposure
      - Performance degradation
    response_time: "< 1 hour"
    escalation: "Security team lead"

  medium:
    characteristics:
      - Suspicious activity
      - Minor vulnerabilities
      - Limited impact
    response_time: "< 4 hours"
    escalation: "Security engineer"

  low:
    characteristics:
      - Policy violations
      - Failed access attempts
      - Routine issues
    response_time: "< 24 hours"
    escalation: "System administrator"
```
