# 241213_INFRA_REGION_INT_v1.0_ANFL

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
This document defines the regional architecture, data sovereignty, and failover procedures for Aeon Nova’s multi-region infrastructure to ensure global scalability, compliance, and resilience.

## Regional Architecture

### 1. Global Deployment Strategy

#### 1.1 Multi-Region Design
- **Regions**:
  - Primary: `us-west-1`, `eu-central-1`.
  - Secondary: `ap-southeast-1`, `sa-east-1`.
- **Design Principles**:
  - High availability through region failover.
  - Compliance with local data sovereignty regulations.

#### 1.2 Networking
- **VPC Configuration**:
  - CIDR Ranges: Non-overlapping across regions.
  - Subnets:
    - Public: Internet-facing resources.
    - Private: Secure internal services.
- **Traffic Management**:
  - Global Accelerator for optimized routing.
  - Route53 for DNS management.

### 2. Security Considerations
- **Encryption**:
  - Data at rest: AES-256-GCM.
  - Data in transit: TLS 1.3.
- **Access Control**:
  - IAM policies scoped to regions.
  - Role-based access control for sensitive operations.

## Data Sovereignty

### 3. Regulatory Compliance

#### 3.1 Data Localization
- **Policy**:
  - Store and process data in the user’s region of origin.
  - Align storage with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations.

#### 3.2 Cross-Border Transfers
- **Protocols**:
  - Use encrypted tunnels (VPN/PrivateLink) for inter-region transfers.
  - Maintain logs of cross-border data flows.

### 4. Retention Policies
- **Strategies**:
  - Adhere to local regulations for data retention.
  - Use lifecycle policies for automatic data deletion.

## Failover Procedures

### 5. Disaster Recovery

#### 5.1 Failover Architecture
- **Setup**:
  - Active-Passive failover between primary and secondary regions.
  - Replication of critical data across regions.

#### 5.2 Recovery Process
- **Steps**:
  - Detect failure using monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Prometheus).
  - Trigger DNS updates via Route53.
  - Spin up resources in the secondary region.

### 6. Testing and Validation
- **Schedule**:
  - Monthly failover drills.
  - Quarterly disaster recovery plan audits.

## Version History
| Version | Date       | Changes                              |
|---------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1.0.0   | 2024-12-13 | Initial regional architecture document |

## Next Steps
1. Implement regional VPCs with non-overlapping CIDRs.
2. Set up encrypted cross-region data transfers.
3. Conduct the first failover drill in Q1 2025.
