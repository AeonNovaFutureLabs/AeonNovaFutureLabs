# 241213_DEV_INTEGRATION_INT_v1.0_ANFL

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
This document details integration patterns, security requirements, and performance guidelines to ensure seamless and secure integration of the Aeon Nova system components.

## Integration Framework

### 1. Integration Patterns

#### 1.1 Microservices Architecture
- **Design**:
  - Stateless services for better scalability.
  - API Gateway as the single entry point.
- **Implementation**:
  - RESTful services using FastAPI.
  - Secure communication via mTLS.

#### 1.2 Event-Driven Architecture
- **Design**:
  - Use of message queues (e.g., AWS SQS, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing.
- **Implementation**:
  - Event producers and consumers for workflow triggers.
  - Dead-letter queues for error handling.

### 2. Security Requirements

#### 2.1 Authentication and Authorization
- **Mechanisms**:
  - OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
  - JWT for session management.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for resource permissions.

#### 2.2 Data Security
- **In Transit**:
  - TLS 1.3 enforced for all communication.
- **At Rest**:
  - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data.

#### 2.3 Security Best Practices
- Regular vulnerability scanning.
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline.
- Use of secrets management tools like Vault.

### 3. Performance Guidelines

#### 3.1 Load Testing
- Conduct regular load tests to simulate high-traffic scenarios.
- Use tools like JMeter or k6 for realistic traffic simulation.

#### 3.2 Caching Strategy
- Implement Redis as a caching layer to reduce latency.
- Cache frequently accessed API responses and database queries.

#### 3.3 Scalability
- Enable auto-scaling for key services.
- Use Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) for resource optimization.
