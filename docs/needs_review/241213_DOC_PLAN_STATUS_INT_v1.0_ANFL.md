## Governance Model
- **Quarterly Review:** Infra, Security, and ML leads convene to review high-priority docs.
- **Bi-Annual Review:** Architecture and resource management docs reviewed alongside major infra updates.
- **Ad-Hoc Updates:** If new technologies are integrated or compliance requirements change, update relevant docs promptly.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Infra Team:** Maintains architecture, deployment, and infrastructure-related docs.
- **ML Team:** Oversees neural network, vector store, and model registry documentation.
- **Security Team:** Manages security frameworks, compliance, and audit procedure docs.
- **Ops Team:** Handles maintenance, operational procedures, and monitoring documentation.
- **Dev Lead:** Responsible for development guidelines, API specs, and integration best practices.
